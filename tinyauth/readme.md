# tinyauth

> A tiny passwordless auth service

This template "saasifies" an example REST API [httbin.org](https://httpbin.org).

Saasify acts as a proxy in front of this external API to handle auth, billing, rate limiting, etc. This allows your backend API to focus solely on your product's unique value proposition.

Once you're ready, you'll want to replace this `backendUrl` with a URL pointing to your SaaS product's externally hosted backend API.

See our [quick start](https://docs.saasify.sh/#/quick-start) for a walkthrough of how to get started.
